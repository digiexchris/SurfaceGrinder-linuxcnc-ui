# SG CNC for linuxcnc

#### Surface Grinder CNC
Semi-automatic surface grinder interface similar to hydraulic grinders, but with extra functionality

The left/right traverse allows for all 3 dimensions, so it's possible to traverse at a 3d angle instead of just horizontally!

Infeed also takes a 3d vector, so you can do in/out stepover like usual, but can also plunge or do an angle instead.

TODO:

Make a calculator that sets the stepover vector according to angles
